title: Weird phenomenon in Google Trends for ReactJS and AngularJS
date: 2016-11-10

[Google Trends] shows and compares how frequent particular terms were searched for in google.
So like, it tells you how _popular_ something is.

Being a JS enthusiast, I wanted to see how [ReactJS] fairs against [AngularJS].
This is the trends chart:

<div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/760_RC08/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/012l1vxv","geo":"","time":"today 5-y"},{"keyword":"/m/0j45p7w","geo":"","time":"today 5-y"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"q=%2Fm%2F012l1vxv,%2Fm%2F0j45p7w"}); </script>
</div>

Each year since 2013, somewhere around 28th December, AngularJS falls quite a bit.
And React goes up by a small, yet increasing, percentage.

As a simple google search didn't yield any results, I now turn to the community.
