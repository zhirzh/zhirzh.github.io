Currently in BITS Pilani college, I am pursuing a double major in Biology and Mechanical. But my heart belongs to computers.

I'm attracted to many things, but web development lies in the centre of it all. Websites, web scraping, simple server setups, and many more things that give me an excuse to learn something new and find some fun problems to solve.

Lately, I have tried my hands on basics of machine learning and data analysis, and have decided to explore the latter further.

To keep things short, let's just say that...
